# Portfolio Template

## Description

This website serves as a framework for a professional portfolio that we will use for future jobseeking. Its purpose is to display deployed applications to potential employers. This deployment was built from the ground up and was an introduction to the idea, requiring understanding of Git, HTML, and CSS fundamentals. As I have no real web apps deployed at the time of publishing, the images and links are simply place holders for future content.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jakester101/portfolio-template.git
```

## Usage

This project deploys as an [HTML website.](https://jakester101.github.io/portfolio-template) and links to other websites.
